# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q2

> Work in Progress

### The daemon is stable and so core is reliable

- `PX` - OWNER - The uncaught errors and memory usage are under control and a daemon can run for a week non stop
- `PX` - OWNER - One or more js-ipfs daemons are part of the IPFS infrastructure
- `PX` - OWNER - js.ipfs.io exposes an IPFS Gateway provided by a js-ipfs daemon

### The core can handle vast amounts of data

- `PX` - OWNER - The MFS is implemented in js-ipfs
- `PX` - OWNER - npm on IPFS is used as a test vector of js-ipfs capabilities
- `PX` - OWNER - js-ipfs in the browser can load a dataset of at least 100Gb (create archives.js.ipfs.io)
- `PX` - OWNER - js-ipfs in Node.js can load a dataset of at least 1TB (use npm to prove it)
- `PX` - OWNER - A S3 IPFS Repo backend exists and it is easily pluggable on `new IPFS`
- `PX` - OWNER - The PIN API is finished and merged.

### The APIs are more ergonomic and developer productivity is off the charts

- `PX` - OWNER - Complete the first milestone of the Awesome Endeavour - Flow
- `PX` - OWNER - Roadmap and Kickstart the second milestone for the Awesome Endeavour - Flow
- `PX` - OWNER - Make js-ipfs uglify friendly again
- `PX` - OWNER - Every env test run is parallelized in CI
- `PX` - OWNER - CLI, HTTP-API and Core Tests of js-ipfs are parallelized in CI
- `PX` - OWNER - A repo migration utility exists and migration is a good experience for js-ipfs users

### libp2p levels up, learns new superpowers and a dedicated team is formed

- `PX` - OWNER - libp2p has primitives to keep connections under control
- `PX` - OWNER - Readable Streams no more! Reduce the overhead of Readable -> Pull in libp2p-mplex
- `PX` - OWNER - The libp2p.next() refactor is complete
- `PX` - OWNER - Delegated Peer Routing and Content Routing modules are created
- `PX` - OWNER - Browsers no longer rely on static rendezvous points for Discovery
- `PX` - OWNER - js-libp2p gets its own OKR spreadsheet for next Q3

### The Community is pumped by having a selection of example applications, blog posts and video tutorials on how to build DApps with IPFS

- `PX` - OWNER - Blog post on PeerPad Architecture with focus on its Read/Write Capability System
- `PX` - OWNER - The Exchange Files example gets a new face and becomes a fully usable app for exchange files (e.g files.js.ipfs.io)
- `PX` - OWNER - Identify the top 3 examples that would help the majority of the developers to understand how to use IPFS
